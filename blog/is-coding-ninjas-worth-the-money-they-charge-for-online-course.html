                    <p>In 1 word &ldquo;YES&rdquo; it is worth the money they charge.</p>
                    <p>Let me explain in-depth how it is worth.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Firstly understand that Coding Ninjas don&rsquo;t just charge for their videos there are many
                        other benefits you get along it which separates it from other similar sites which provides
                        similar courses at low price.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Let me explain it with my own experience:</p>
                    <p>I joined coding ninjas competitive programming course when I was at std 12 because I wanted to
                        participate in IOI which is International Olymipads in Informatics. It has same syllabus as
                        competitive programming. And That time I only knew some basic Data Structures. And could not
                        find anyone to guide me for it. Hence I searched online and get to know about coding ninjas
                        course.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>After explaining my parents why I needed that course, my parents allowed me to purchase the
                        course which cost me around Rs 10000/-. At that time I didn&rsquo;t knew much and struggled a
                        lot in problem solving but with time improved a lot.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <img src="../assets/blog/cp-certificate.png" alt="course completion certificate">
                    <p><strong>Teaching Assistance </strong>: During the course whenever I have doubt regardless of how
                        silly doubt it was, I can always raise a doubt and get response within 10 minutes to 1 hour
                        mostly.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>Content </strong>: The best thing I liked about coding ninjas was I don&rsquo;t had to
                        google around for different topics, All the topics are already covered with enough problems to
                        practice, sorted in increasing difficulty order which makes learning so easy.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>Result </strong>: After completing I gave my ZCO (zonal computing olympiads) exam and got
                        selected for the Next Level.</p>
                    <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>Improvement in competitive sites</strong>: After the course i was now able to solve
                        medium level problems and improve my ranking, before the course I used to stuck after solving
                        1<sup>st</sup> two problems but now I can solve more problems.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>Problem Setting</strong>: Apart from this best part till now was I had also set few
                        problems on codechef contest now.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Moreover, after the completion of the course, Coding Ninjas provides Internship and Job
                        opportunities in various companies including Coding Ninjas itself. I&nbsp;<strong>applied for
                            Teaching Assistant Internship in Coding Ninjas&nbsp;</strong>after the completion of my
                        course.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <img src="../assets/blog/cn-jobs.png" alt="coding ninjas jobs">

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>The selection was based on a Coding Test which I passed easily and got selected as a Teaching
                        Assistant. My role is to help other students in code/concepts in the course which I completed
                        recently. So, this&nbsp;<strong>Internship provided me complete revision of the course</strong>.
                        It is a paid internship and providing me a stipend of 30k.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <img src="../assets/blog/taship-email.png" alt="Teaching Assistance Job Mail">
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>So, overall I invested 10k in the course and in return I learnt a lot and got an internship of
                        30k. Hence, it proved to be a value for money deal !</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Therefore, if you are interested in any of the course provided by Coding Ninjas, don&rsquo;t
                        think much&hellip;. Just go for it and trust me .. you won&rsquo;t regret on your decision !!
                    </p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>It is an investment for upskilling yourself !!</strong></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>If you still have any doubt, you may take a&nbsp;<strong>Free Trial of any
                            course</strong>&nbsp;of your choice to experience all the features along with
                        a&nbsp;<strong>Certificate of Completion</strong>.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I am telling you in brief all those things about the course, which I personally liked the most
                        and I think that you should also know these things -</p>
                    <p><strong>Placement Assistance -&nbsp;</strong>After completing the course, Coding Ninjas ensures
                        that you should get the right track in future. It provides various internships and jobs
                        opportunities with a good stipend. With the help of these, you can get back your course fees
                        within a month. So, I consider it just like an investment !!</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Teaching Assistance -</strong>&nbsp;If in case you have any problem or doubt regarding
                        any topic, concept, question or anything, you can ask in from the teaching assistant. They
                        explain you the solution very clearly. You may ask them any doubt as many time as you want. You
                        will definitely get the solution within few hours.</p>

                        themselves.</p>
                    <br>

                    <p><strong>Refer &amp; Earn Scheme -</strong>&nbsp;I personally loved this scheme a lot. After
                        taking the course, you can refer other students to take Coding Ninjas courses. You can provide
                        them 1000 rupees additional discount and you also get 1000 rupees in your wallet which you can
                        use to buy further courses.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Hint Videos -</strong>&nbsp;Almost all the problems are backed up by a hint video. If you
                        face any problem in any assignment question, you can see the video which explains the concept
                        used to solve the problem. But you need to do the coding part yourself.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Goodies -</strong>&nbsp;Coding Ninjas also provide goodies to all the enrolled students.
                        These goodies are really AWESOME. It includes a wildcraft bag, a coding ninjas t-shirt and some
                        laptop stickers.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I think this would be enough for you to decide yourself whether the courses worth for the money
                        or not !!</p>

                    <h3>Pros and Cons of Coding Ninjas:
                    </h3>
                    <p>So, let’s know about the Pros and Cons of the Coding Ninjas in this Coding Ninjas Review.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Pros of the course:-</h3>
                    <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li> The mentors here are from IIT, IIIT, and Stanford Universities.</li>
                        <li>We can pause our course for 60 days for any purpose such as exams, functions, or
                            assignments.
                        </li>
                        <li>If we want to re-watch some of the videos at the time of placement so that we can revise all
                            the topics again, we can get 15 days extension where we can watch the video again and also a
                            1-month extension if we pay some price.</li>
                        <li> We will get 24*7 Teaching Assistance (TA) support where we can ask as many doubts as we
                            want.
                        </li>
                        <li> There will be 1 on 1 interaction with TA’s where we can ask our doubts via video
                            conferencing through a Jitsy Meeting App, where we can also present our screen.</li>
                        <li>We can also connect to our batch mates and some other coders in the same field through
                            slack, discord, or via WhatsApp.</li>
                    </ol>
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Cons of the course:-</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>I could not find any Cons of the course. Except it's bit expensive for students to enroll in
                            the
                            course.</li>
                        <li>There are times where the Teaching Assistants just Copy and Paste the code, which is
                            annoying.
                            But you can re-raise a doubt and some other TA will explain it properly.</li>
                        <li>The course is not for lifetime access and as the deadline ends of the course will be
                            removed,
                            However, this may be a reason to fight piracy.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <br>

                    <p>"Despite being from a tier 3 college, I would like to thank my mentors & teachers at Coding
                        Ninjas
                        who helped me land a job at Google. Both Parikh sir and Ankush sir are brilliant teachers who
                        know how to explain difficult concepts in an easy way." <strong> - Manchanda
                            (Software Engineer)</strong></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The experience and knowledge I learned at Coding Ninjas greatly sharpened my skills and allowed
                        me to pass the HackerRank and technical interview rounds. The placement team coordinated
                        everything perfectly and it was unbelievable to get an offer letter of 10 LPA. Grateful to
                        Coding Ninjas.<strong>- Harsh Agarwal (Software Engineer) </strong></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>My experience with Coding Ninjas was wonderful. The courses strengthened my concepts and helped
                        me in my interviews. The faculty was amazing. I would definitely recommend Coding
                        Ninjas.<strong> - Satwika Bhattacharjee (Analyst) </strong></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>It has been a crazy ride from being a novice CS student to a 6 star Coder and ICPC Regionalist. I
                        would like to thank Coding Ninjas for helping a Tier-3 college student explore such
                        opportunities.<strong> - Rahul Lather (Member of Technical Staff) </strong></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Coding Ninjas is one of the best learning platforms. I enrolled into C++ Foundation with Data
                        Structures. The course content was very informative and well structured. The way Ankush Sir and
                        Nidhi Ma'am explain a topic is commendable. My approach towards solving a problem completely
                        changed.<strong> - Richa Sharma (SEP Intern) </strong></p>
